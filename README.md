# Probability
This Python project calculates the probability that at least one of the selected indices from a list of lowercase English letters contains the letter `a`. The project implements two approaches to solve this problem: one using **mathematics** (combinatorics) and the other using the **`itertools`** module.

# Probability Calculation with Mathematical and `itertools` Approaches

## Problem Overview

Given:
- `N`: The number of elements in a list of lowercase English letters.
- A list of letters.
- `K`: The number of indices to be selected.

The goal is to calculate the probability that at least one of the selected indices contains the letter `a`.

### Approaches

#### 1. Mathematical Approach

This approach uses combinatorics to directly compute the probability:
- **Combinations Without 'a'**: Compute how many ways we can select `K` indices that do **not** contain the letter 'a'.
- **Total Combinations**: Compute the total number of ways to select `K` indices from `N` elements.
- **Probability**: The probability of selecting at least one 'a' is computed as the complement of selecting none.

#### 2. `itertools` Approach

This approach uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all possible combinations of `K` indices from the list and checks how many of these contain at least one 'a'. The probability is calculated as the ratio of valid combinations to total combinations.

### Key Functions

- **`probability_of_a(N, letters, K)`** (used for both approaches):
  - **Mathematical Approach**: Uses combinatorics to calculate the probability without generating all combinations.
  - **`itertools` Approach**: Uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate and evaluate all combinations.

### Example

#### Input:
`4 a a c d 2`

#### Output:
`0.8333`


### How to Run the Program

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the directory containing the project files.

#### Running the Mathematical Approach

To run the version of the program that uses mathematical calculations:

`python3 probability_math.py`

### Running the itertools Approach

To run the version of the program that uses itertools to calculate probabilities:

`python3 probability_itertools.py`

### Program Output
**Both versions of the program will prompt you to enter values for N, the list of letters, and K. After inputting these values, the program will output the probability of selecting at least one 'a'.**

#### Requirements
This project requires Python 3.x. It uses the following libraries:

`itertools`: A standard Python library for generating combinations (only for the `itertools` approach).
